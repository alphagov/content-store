## Needed things:

### Controller:

* Format

### View

* API url
* Breadcrumb section links
* Title
* Body (HTML)
* Last updated

* Related (grouped)
* Legacy sources (from tags)

## Deprecated fields to be removed

* business_proposition - If this is still needed it should be implemented as a tag
* need_extended_font - was for a feature that was never fully implemented.
* alternative_title - The only place this is used is in submitting content to rummager - it's added to indexable_content.
  This will be the concern of the publishing tools in future - they'll construct indexable_content themselves.

## Things to be provided

* Tags (TODO: Clarify what details of tags are needed)
* Related artefacts (including their tags)
