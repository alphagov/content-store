# Be Very Careful With Pull Requests

This is a forked repo, so by default Github will think you want to make a PR against
the upstream/base content-store repo](https://github.com/alphagov/content-store).
When raising a PR, *you _must_ manually change the base repository to
this repo!* 

This application is owned by the publishing platform team. Please let us know in #govuk-publishing-platform when you raise any PRs.   

⚠️ This repo is Continuously Deployed: make sure you [follow the guidance](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/development-pipeline.html#merge-your-own-pull-request) ⚠️
