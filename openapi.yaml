  title: GOV.UK Content API
  description: |
    GOV.UK Content API provides a simple and consistent way to request
    [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) content as structured data in a predictable
    format. It is used within the GOV.UK website as the means for applications
    to lookup content in order to render it.

    This API accepts HTTP requests and responds with
    [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data containing the same
    published content as is presented on GOV.UK.

  version: '1.0.0'

      summary: Lookup GOV.UK content by path
      description: |
        This is the primary interface to lookup the content required to render
        a page on GOV.UK

        It accepts an input of the path of the page you are looking up. For
        example, if you were looking up travel advice for Thailand which is
        hosted on GOV.UK at `https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/thailand`
        you would make a request to
        `https://www.gov.uk/api/content/foreign-travel-advice/thailand`.

        If the content is available at the requested path you will receive
        a [`ContentItem`](#schema-contentitem) containing the structured data
        for that page.

        In the GOV.UK context, content schemas are structured rules that define
        what a specific type of content can contain and how it's organised.
        Think of them as a strict blueprint or a template for every piece of
        information published on GOV.UK. These schemas ensure that all content
        is consistent, predictable, and machine-readable.

        Each schema is a formal definition, written in JSON Schema, that
        specifies the underlying structure for a content type. For example, a
        schema for a "News Article" would define all the possible fields for
        that article, such as:

        - title: A mandatory text field with a maximum character limit.
        - summary: A mandatory short description.
        - body: The main content of the article, which itself must conform
          to the rules of Govspeak (GOV.UK's version of Markdown).
        - publication_date: A mandatory field that must be in a valid date
          format.
        - image: An optional field that must contain specific sub-fields like
          a URL and alt text.
        - related_links: A list where each item must have a title and a URL.

        By enforcing these rules, schemas guarantee that every news article
        across GOV.UK has the same fundamental structure.
